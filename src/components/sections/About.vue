            Hallo! I'm {{ user.userName }}. Ever since I was a kid, I've always loved computers and video games, which led me into taking a degree in Computer Science, because it had the word 'computer' in it ðŸ˜… But I'm glad I did! It was one of the most satisfying decisions I've ever made.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a 4th year graduating student, currently studying Computer Science in MCL. I held leadership positions in our college council and national and international organizations' student chapters that involves the field of computing and ICT. I am a recipient of the OWWA EDSP scholarship, a competitive program that only selects top students across all regions of the Philippines qualified by DOST-SEI. Knowledge is my passion, and programming more so. I am fully competent in various frameworks and languages, and eager and persistent to learn even more!
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, I am usually playing games with my friends, hanging out with them, chilling to music, reading novels, or watching Netflix or anime ;)
